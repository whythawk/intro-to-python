    "Data has become the most important language of our era, informing everything from intelligence in automated machines, to predictive analytics in medical diagnostics. The plunging cost and easy accessibility of the raw requirements for such systems - data, software, distributed computing, and sensors - are driving the adoption and growth of data-driven decision-making. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it becomes ever-easier to collect data about individuals and systems, a diverse range of professionals - who have never been trained for such requirements - grapple with inadequate analytic and data management skills, as well as the ethical risks arising from the possession and consequences of such data and tools.\n",

    "## Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers cannot make decisions. Their output is an absolute function of the data provided as input, and the algorithms applied to analyse that input. The aid of computers in decision-making does not override human responsibility and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be expected that both data and algorithms should stand up to scrutiny so as to justify any and all decisions made as a result of their output. \"Computer says no,\" is not an unquestionable statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our actions - as data scientists - are intended to persuade people to act or think other than the way they currently do based on nothing more than the strength of our analysis, and informed by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process by which we examine and explain why what we consider to be right or wrong, is considered right or wrong in matters of human conduct, belongs to the study of ethics.\n",

    "<b><i>Case-study</i></b>: _Polygal_ was a gel made from beet and apple pectin. Administered to a severely wounded patient, it was supposed to reduce bleeding. To test this hypothesis, [Sigmund Rascher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Rascher) administered a tablet to human subjects who were then shot or - without anesthesia - had their limbs amputated.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "During the Second World War, and under the direction of senior Nazi officers, medical experiments of quite unusual violence were conducted on prisoners of war and civilians regarded by the Nazi regime as sub-human. After the war, twenty medical doctors were tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity at the [Doctor's Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors%27_trial) held in Nuremberg from 1946 to 1949.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In 1947 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Blome\">Kurt Blome</a> - Deputy Reich Health Leader, a high-ranking Nazi scientist - was acquitted of war crimes on the strength of intervention by the United States. Within two months, he was being debriefed by the US military who wished to learn everything he knew about biological warfare.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<i>Do you feel the US was \"right\" or \"wrong\" to offer Blome immunity from prosecution in exchange for what he knew?</i>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "There were numerous experiments conducted by the Nazis that raise ethical dilemmas, including: immersing prisoners in freezing water to observe the result and test hypothermia revival techniques; high altitude pressure and decompression experiments; sulfanilamide tests for treating gangrene and other bacterial infections.\n",

    "Whereas everything else we do can describe human behaviour as it _is_, ethics provides a theoretical framework to describe the world as it _should_, or _should not_ be. It gives us full range to describe an ideal outcome, and to consider all that we know and do not know which may impede or confound our desired result.\n",

    "<b><i>Case-study</i></b>: A Nigerian man travels to a conference in the United States. After one of the sessions, he goes to the bathroom to wash his hands. The electronic automated soap dispensor does not recognise his hands beneath the sensor. A white American sees his confusion and places his hands beneath the device. Soap is dispensed. The Nigerian man tries again. It still does not recognise him.\n",

    "When we consider ethical outcomes, we use the terms _good_ or _bad_ to describe judgements about people or things, and we use _right_ or _wrong_ to refer to the outcome of specific actions. Understand, though, that - while right and wrong may sometimes be obvious - we are often stuck in ethical dilemmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we consider whether an action is right or wrong comes down to the tension between what was intended by an action, and what the consequences of that action were. Are only intensions important? Or should we only consider outcomes? And how absolutely do you want to judge this chain: the _right_ motivation, leading to the _right_ intention, performing the _right_ action, resulting in only _good_ consequences. How do we evaluate this against what it may be impossible to know at the time, even if that information will become available after a decision is made?\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to consider competing interests in good and bad outcomes. A good outcome for the individual making the decision may be a bad decision for numerous others. Conversely, an altruistic person may act only for the benefit of others even to their own detriment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical problems do not always require a call to facts to justify a particular decision, but they do have a number of characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    " - _Public_: the process by which we arrive at an ethical choice is known to all participants;\n",
    " - _Informal_: the process cannot always be codified into law like a legal system;\n",
    " - _Rational_: despite the informality, the logic used must be accessible and defensible;\n",
    " - _Impartial_: any decision must not favour any group or person;\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than imposing a specific set of rules to be obeyed, ethics provides a framework in which we may consider whether what we are setting out to achieve conforms to our values, and whether the process by which we arrive at our decision can be validated and inspected by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how sophisticated our automated machines become, unless our intention is to construct a society \"of machines, for machines\", people will always be needed to decide on what ethical considerations must be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are limits to what analysis can achieve, and it is up to the individuals producing that analysis to ensure that any assumptions, doubts, and requirements are documented along with their results. Critically, it is also each individual's personal responsibility to raise any concerns with the source data used in the analysis, including whether personal data are being used legitimately, or whether the source data are at all trustworthy, as well as the algorithms used to process those data and produce a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be a very brief introduction to some tools used in data analysis in Python. This will not provide insight into the approaches to performing analysis, which is left to self-study, or to modules elsewhere in this series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numpy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis often involves performing operations on large lists of data. Numpy is a powerful suite of tools permitting you to work quickly and easily with complete data lists. We refer to these lists as arrays, and - if you are familiar with the term from mathematics - you can think of these as matrix methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, we import Numpy as np; `import numpy as np`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also going to want to be generating a lot of lists of random floats for these exercises, and that's tedious to write. Let's get Python to do this for us using the `random` module."

Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**._\n",
